## AI Smart Quizzer  
### Adaptive Quiz & Question Generator  

### Description  
AI Smart Quizzer is an intelligent and adaptive quiz platform designed to make learning personalized and engaging.  
Unlike traditional quizzes that use fixed questions, this system dynamically adjusts question difficulty based on the learner’s performance.  
It also allows users and admins to upload their own study materials (like PDFs or notes) to automatically generate quizzes, helping students assess themselves on any topic they choose.
